# Daily Alert Monitoring Script

This project is a **daily monitoring system** that compares financial transaction data from two different sources:
1. **Payment Database** (requires login)  
2. **Bank Statement Website** (requires login)  

The main goal is to ensure data consistency between both systems by comparing the **remarks** column.  
Any mismatches are recorded in a .txt report and sent to a **Telegram bot** for daily monitoring.

## Schedule & Automation
The script runs **once daily at 07:00 AM** server time via a scheduled job.
